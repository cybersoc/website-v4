        After being founded in 2019, CyberSoc has brought an incredible variety of events and activities to students here
        at Cardiff University, whether in-person or online.

        Being a newer society has not stopped us from achieving great things;
        after being awarded The Best Large Society award of 2021,
        we aim to continue our work to become an integral aspect of student life.

        If you are a Cardiff University student interested in tech,
        we highly recommend joining our society.

        We hope to see you at one of our events soon.
